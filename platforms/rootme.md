# Root-Me

### Overview

**Root-Me** is an established training platform for cybersecurity that offers a wide range of hands-on challenges. It covers a broad set of categories including web security, reverse engineering, cryptography, steganography, and system exploitation.

The platform emphasizes practical learning — every challenge simulates a real-world scenario where vulnerabilities must be identified and exploited. Through Root-Me, I’ve been able to deepen my understanding of different attack vectors and refine my technical skills step by step.

This section contains my writeups and notes from Root-Me challenges, serving as both a reference for myself and a way to share insights with others who are also learning through the platform.
