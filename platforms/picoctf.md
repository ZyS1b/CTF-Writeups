# PicoCTF

### Overview

**PicoCTF** is an online **Capture The Flag (CTF)** platform created by security experts at Carnegie Mellon University. It is designed as an accessible entry point into cybersecurity, offering challenges that gradually increase in difficulty across areas like cryptography, web exploitation, reverse engineering, binary exploitation, and forensics.

Working on PicoCTF gave me a structured way to sharpen my problem-solving skills and experiment with different tools and techniques. Each challenge pushed me to think critically and apply concepts in practical ways, which has been valuable in building a stronger foundation for more advanced CTFs.

This section contains my personal writeups for the challenges Iâ€™ve solved, documenting the approaches I tried, the solutions I arrived at, and the lessons learned along the way.
