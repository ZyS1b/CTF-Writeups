# Kaspersky{CTF}

### Overview

**Kaspersky{CTF}** is a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competition organized by **Kaspersky**, bringing together students from around the world to tackle challenges in different areas of cybersecurity. The event serves as both a competition and a learning opportunity, with problems designed to reflect real-world security scenarios.

For this CTF, I will be joining a new team called **Puppies**, composed of students from **PUP Sta. Mesa**. As a fresh lineup, our goal is to collaborate, learn from each challenge, and measure ourselves against participants from other institutions.

This page will later contain our teamâ€™s writeups once the competition concludes, covering the challenges we attempt, the solutions we develop, and the insights we gain throughout the event.
