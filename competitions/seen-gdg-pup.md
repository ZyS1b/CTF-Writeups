# SEEN (GDG PUP)

### Overview

**SEEN** is a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competition organized by **Google Developer Groups (GDG) PUP**. It brings together students and aspiring security enthusiasts to solve challenges across different areas of cybersecurity.

This was my second time joining SEEN. I also participated in last year’s event, but I wasn’t able to make writeups then since I was just starting out with CTFs.

For this year, I competed with my team **IncepXion**, composed of my fellow Computer Engineering students. We started as beginners, but throughout the competition we were able to adapt quickly, learn from each other, and tackle challenges more effectively.

We placed **18th out of 29 teams**, and while the ranking wasn’t at the top, the experience was valuable. It gave us hands-on exposure to real challenges, improved our teamwork under pressure, and highlighted areas we need to strengthen moving forward.

This page contains our team’s writeups, showcasing the challenges we worked on, the approaches we took, and the lessons we learned throughout the competition.
