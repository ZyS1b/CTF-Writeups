# Trend Micro uCTF

### Overview

**Trend Micro uCTF** is a **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competition organized by **Trend Micro** for universities across the Philippines. It brings together students from different schools to compete in solving a wide range of cybersecurity challenges.

I joined this competition as part of **Pulang\_Sambalilo**, a team made up of students from diverse tech-related programs — Computer Science, IT, and Computer Engineering — all from PUP Sta. Mesa. The mix of backgrounds gave us different perspectives and approaches when solving challenges, which helped us collaborate more effectively.

Out of **199 participating teams**, we finished in **90th place**. While there was still a large gap between us and the top contenders, the result showed that our collective effort and quick learning paid off. More importantly, the competition gave us a clearer picture of the skills and strategies needed to perform better in future CTFs, and it motivated us to keep improving.

The following writeups cover the challenges tackled by the team, detailing the problem-solving process, solutions derived, and important lessons learned during the competition.
