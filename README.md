### About Me

> My name is **Zybert Jio D. Sibolboro** ([**@ZyS1b**](https://github.com/ZyS1b)), a computer engineering student passionate about software development, robotics, and cybersecurity. I actively participate in **Capture The Flag (CTF)** events and platforms, tackling challenges that test both creativity and technical skill. This site is where I organize and share my writeups, documenting the solutions I have built, the lessons I have learned, and the progress I continue to make in the field of security.
